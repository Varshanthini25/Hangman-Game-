# Hangman Game with GUI

## Project Overview

This is a **Hangman** word-guessing game implemented with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows users to select a category and guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The game features:

- Multiple word categories (fruits, animals, birds, sports, planets, trees, technologies).
- Letter-by-letter guessing with visual feedback.
- A limited number of incorrect attempts (7 tries).
- A **60-second countdown timer** for each word — when the timer runs out, the word resets automatically.
- Interactive GUI elements for a user-friendly experience.
- Option to reset the game anytime.

## Technologies Used

Python 3 — Programming language for the entire project.

Tkinter — Python’s built-in library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

Random — Python standard library module to select random words from categories.

Time — Standard Python module to implement countdown timer functionality.
